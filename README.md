airbnb applies machine learning using TensorFlow to classify objects to improve the guest experience
Paypal is using TensorFlow to detect fraud patterns and help increase the experience of legitimate users through increased prescision in identification.

### Features 
TensorFlow uses a wide range of abstraction and made it possible to choose a lot of options for your needs
Two of them helps us with specific needs
- To build and train models, TensorFlow have high-level Keras APIs which make starting with TensorFlow and machine learning very easy
- If more flexibility is needed, Eager execution allows for immedieate iteration and intuitive debugging, when using Eager execution, TensorFlow kernels will be executed immediately rather than constructing graphs that will be excuted later

## Google Cloud Platform
Google is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the sam infrastructure that uses internally for its end-user products
