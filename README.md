TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library. It is the most used machine learning framework in the world with a huge community behind it. Training data, creating model, solving prediction, and refining future results can be done with ease with tensorflow  
TensorFlow is used in a lot of companies in industries

airbnb applies machine learning using TensorFlow to classify objects to improve the guest experience
Paypal is using TensorFlow to detect fraud patterns and help increase the experience of legitimate users through increased prescision in identification.

### Features 
TensorFlow uses a wide range of abstraction and made it possible to choose a lot of options for your needs
Two of them helps us with specific needs
- To build and train models, TensorFlow have high-level Keras APIs which make starting with TensorFlow and machine learning very easy
- If more flexibility is needed, Eager execution allows for immedieate iteration and intuitive debugging, when using Eager execution, TensorFlow kernels will be executed immediately rather than constructing graphs that will be excuted later

## Google Cloud Platform

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the sam infrastructure that uses internally for its end-user products. The services in GCP are divided by domains. The main domains are basically computing, storage, networking, and many more
### Compute Domain
The compute domain has four kinds of services which is compute engine, app engine, kubernetes engine, and cloud functions
- The compute engine is basically the raw server with the OS of our choice
- The app engine is the extension of the compute engine for developing and hosting web applications at scale
- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) provides a managed environment for deploying, managing, and scaling your containerized applications using Google infrastructure.
- Google Cloud Functions is Google's serverless compute solution for creating event-driven applications.
### Storage Domain
Three of the storage domain services are
- Datastore automatically handles sharding and replication, providing a highly available and durable database that scales automatically to handle an applications' load
- Storage is a service for storing your objects in Google Cloud.
- Cloud SQL is a fully-managed database service that helps set up, maintain, manage, and administer your relational databases on Google Cloud Platform
### Networking Domain
The netwotking domain gives a Virtual Private Cloud which provides networking functionality to Compute Engine including Google Kubernetes Engine clusters and the App Engine environment
